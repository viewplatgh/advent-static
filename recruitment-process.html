							Our Recruitment Process
						</h2>		
						<p><i><em>“The right people in the right roles for now and into the future.”</em></i></p>	
						<p>
							At Advent Pharma, we know that the one thing that makes us stand apart from our competition is our people. 
						</p>
						<p>
							To help us find the right people, we invest a lot of time and effort into the recruitment and selection process.  Our recruitment process is rigorous but we believe that the investment that we put in up front to find the right mix of cultural fit, skills, experience and future capability gives everyone the best chance for a successful and rewarding long term employment relationship. 					
						</p>
						<p>
							Our selection process is not based solely on academic achievements; we use a combination of structured interviews, ability assessments, case studies and role play activities to select the best candidate for the position. 					
						</p>
						<p>
							Our selection process gives you the opportunity to show us why you’re a great fit for our company and how you can add value to the company and grow the scope of your role.					
						</p>
						<p>
							During the recruitment process, you’ll meet a range of Advent Pharma people and you’ll have the opportunity to ask questions and determine whether Advent Pharma is the right company for you.					
						</p>
						<p>
							At Advent Pharma, we’re committed to a fair and transparent recruitment process for every role, and whilst the process may vary, generally the recruitment process is based on the following structure:					
						</p>
						<div>
							<a href="#process-1"><span id="process">Apply</span></a>
							<div id="process-arrow"><i class="fa fa-arrow-right fa-2x"></i></div>

							<a href="#process-8"><span id="process">Offer</span></a>
						</div>
						<p>
							The timeline, number of steps and evaluation process will vary across the company and departments, but the standard process for most positions follows these eight steps. 		
						</p>
						<h3><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#process-1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="process-1">1. Applying for a Position</a></h3>
						<div class="collapse in" id="process-1">
							<p>
								You can create a profile and submit an application online via our quick process.  To complete your application, you will need to upload two documents; your résumé and a cover/application letter.					
							</p>
							<h4>a) Your Resume – Some simple tips</h4>
							<p>
								Your resume is your marketing document so it is critical that the document highlights what you have achieved in your career.   Your resume does not need to be fancy to have impact – the rule of thumb is to “keep it simple”.  Your resume should include your contact details, a summary of your skills, education, professional memberships and your work history in reverse chronological order.  Highlighting specific examples of past successes and achievements in your resume document assists us in determining the value and experience that you could add to Advent Pharma. You should not include any personal details that are not relevant to your application; such as a photo, your marital status, family details or your date of birth. 					
							</p>
							<h4>Your Application Letter – Why is this important?</h4>
							<p>
								Your application letter is a separate document to your resume.
								We value an application letter as this is an ideal way for you to communicate to us why you are motivated to apply and what value you feel that you can bring to Advent Pharma.   Your application letter should be written using the same structure as a business letter.  Your application letter doesn't have to be lengthy to be effective. Three or four short paragraphs are usually sufficient.
							</p>
							<h4>Find out more about the opportunities</h4>
							<p>
								We have an open and honest approach to selecting people to become part of the Advent Pharma family.  If you have any questions about the opportunities available, we encourage you to pick up the phone and call us prior to submitting an application.   We are a small HR team and whilst we may not be available immediately to speak to you, rest assured that we will respond to your call.
								If you would like to discuss potentially working at Advent Pharma, please call (02) 8877 8288 and ask to speak to HR.					
							</p>
						</div>
						<h3><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#process-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="process-2">2. Application Review</a></h3>
						<div class="collapse in" id="process-2">
							<p>
								Your application will be reviewed by Human Resources and the manager recruiting for the position against the inherent requirements for the position.  If your experience, work history and education is relevant to the position, we will contact you.
							</p>
						</div>
						<h3><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#process-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="process-3">3. Phone Interview</a></h3>
						<div class="collapse in" id="process-3">
							<p>
								A phone interview is usually with a member of the Human Resources (HR) team.  This is to gain an understanding of the initial fit for the role and to discuss any concerns about remuneration.
							</p>
						</div>
						<h3><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#process-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="process-4">4. Structured First Interview</a></h3>
						<div class="collapse in" id="process-4">
							<p>
								The first interview is usually with the people manager who is recruiting for the role and a member of the HR team. It is an opportunity to get a detailed understanding of the role and the company, to discuss your career aspirations and to answer behavioural and skills based questions.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Preparing for a Structured Interview</b><br/>
								At Advent Pharma we conduct behavioural based interviews.  This style of interview asks you to demonstrate your capability and experience by responding to the interview questions with specific examples about your experience.  Ideally, we are looking for you to be able to think about a particular experience you have had, summarise the context of the situation and step us through the actions you took to achieve the outcome.  Before the interview think about past work situations that illustrate your skills and highlight your successes and key achievements.					
							</p>
						</div>
						<h3><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#process-5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="process-5">5. Ability Testing / Case Studies / Role Plays</a></h3>
						<div class="collapse in" id="process-5">
							<p>
								Should your application be progressed to the next stage in the process, you will then be invited to complete some Ability and Psychometric assessments.  Depending upon the role, you may also be asked to complete a case study and/or role play or some other activity that closely simulates the working environment. These assessments provide us with further objective information to consider in our hiring decision.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>More on Ability and Psychometric Assessments:</b>  At Advent Pharma we use the global cognitive index (GCI) set of tests. These are psychometric tests and assessments that are used in the assessment of candidates for our positions. The GCI tests are a good predicator of future success and cover three main reasoning areas; Abstract, Verbal and Numerical.  					
							</p>				
							<p>
								<b>a) Global Cognitive Index Abstract Ability Test:</b> This test assesses your ability to think laterally; the aptitude to grasp different concepts quickly and easily. In this test you need to show that you can face a new, different situation, take stock and use your experience and skill to come up with a solution. You will be presented with a sequence of images or matrices that have a specific pattern running through them, a unique relationship with each other. There may be a number of different rules governing this relationship. You have to infer the details of the relationship and use your understanding of it to work out the next step in the sequence.<br/>
								These tests are often known as the “real” IQ test as they are independent of language and can thus be used to assess thinking skills across a wide range of different continents and cultures.					
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>b) Global Cognitive Index Quantitative Ability Test:</b> This test is used to assess your ability to comprehend and use numerical information in a variety of different formats. You will be provided with information that comes in the form of tables, pie charts, analysis reports and other numerical data that you have to shape and manipulate in order to procure the correct answer required. To answer the questions, you will need only basic arithmetic functions. You will however, generally have to do at least two calculations to find the correct answer.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>c) Global Cognitive Index Verbal Reasoning Test:</b>  This test is used to assess your ability to extract information from text and use the information to make correct deductions based on this information. You are also being assessed on your ability to understand relationships between different words.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>d) Ability Tests – Hints and Tips:</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Complete the tests when you are well-rested and alert.</li>
									<li>Ensure you have a good internet connection.</li>
									<li>Ensure that you are free from interruptions and that you are not disturb during the assessments – the assessments are timed and you can’t stop and start the process.</li>
									<li>Complete the practice examples, these will give you an indication of the style of questions used in the assessment.</li>
								</ul>
