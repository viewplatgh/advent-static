							<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
							<p>Advent Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd (ACN 095 494 563) (<b><i>Advent, we, us or our</i></b>) recognises the importance of the privacy of individuals. In conducting its business, Advent collects personal information (which may include sensitive information). This Privacy Policy aims to allow individuals to make their own choices about how Advent uses this personal information. This Privacy Policy sets out how Advent manages personal information to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act and the Australian Privacy Principles. Some of Advent’s actions with respect to employee records are exempt from regulation under the Privacy Act and, therefore, this Privacy Policy. By submitting personal information to us, you agree to our use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy</p>
							<h3>1. Personal information</h3>
							<p>When used in this policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act. Personal information includes information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable from the information or opinion. In summary, personal information is any information about you that can be linked to you. Personal information also includes “sensitive information” (as defined in the Privacy Act). Sensitive information includes information about a person's beliefs or associations.</p>
							<h3>2. Personal information collected and held by Advent</h3>
							<p>The personal information collected may consist of your name, address, telephone number, photo, email address, age or birthdate, company or educational affiliations, profession or occupation, qualifications, titles, contact information, information from your CV and employment records.</p>
							<p>Sensitive information is a specific category of personal information. Such information includes membership of a profession or trade association or of a trade union, health information or criminal record. We may need to collect, hold and disclose sensitive information and if we do, we will get your consent to the collection and use of this information.</p>
							<h3>3. How personal information is collected and held</h3>
							<p>We collect your personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so. We can also collect personal information in a variety of ways, including via this Advent Website (such as when users register or apply for employment), or when you provide personal information to us by other means, such as in-person during conversations with our representatives, over the phone or by email.</p>
							<p>We may also collect personal information from third parties such as employers and persons nominated by you as referees, credit agencies or government agencies.</p>
							<p>Personal information is held by us in secure physical and electronic data systems.</p>
							<h3>4. The purposes for which personal information is collected, held and disclosed</h3>
							<p>We collect personal information about you so that we can perform our business activities and functions, including for the purposes of recruiting staff. We collect, hold and disclose your personal information for the following purposes (in some cases we may only disclose information with your consent):</p>
							<ul>
								<li>to review and process any employment application submitted by you;</li>
								<li>to send communications requested by you, answer enquiries and provide information;</li>
								<li>to provide your updated personal information to our representatives, related bodies corporate, our contractors or service providers if such disclosure is required to administer our business functions and in the case of disclosure to contractors or service providers, for the purpose of those service providers providing services to Advent;</li>
								<li>to update our records and keep your records up to date;</li>
								<li>to process and respond to any complaint made by you; and</li>
								<li>to comply with any law, rule, regulation, lawful and binding determination, decision or direction of a regulator, or in cooperation with any governmental authority of any country.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We will not intentionally disclose (and will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent the accidental disclosure of) your personal information to any other third parties, whether for such third parties' marketing purposes or otherwise, except when we believe we are under a legal duty to do so.</p>
							<p>If we are unable to collect your personal information, we may be unable to fulfil some or all of the purposes listed above.</p>

								<li>any organisation for any authorised purpose with your express consent; and</li>
								<li>should we intend to merge with, sell the majority of our assets or equity to, or obtain significant investment from, a third party, personal information may be disclosed to that third party.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>6. Disclosure outside Australia</h3>
							<p>We may disclose personal information to our related bodies corporate and third party service providers located overseas for some of the purposes listed above. Those overseas entities may be located in Canada and the USA.</p>
							<h3>7. Accessing, changing, and/or deleting information</h3>
							<p>You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us. Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you with a suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you). We will not charge for making the request or for making any corrections to your personal information. To do so, please contact us by the means set out in section 10 below. We will then contact you to request sufficient information to allow us to confirm your identity. As soon as practicable after your request is received, we will give you access to your personal information.</p>
							<p>There may be times when we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, if access would interfere with the privacy of others or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality or law, we will not be required to grant you access. We will let you know if this is the case.</p>
							<p>If you believe that the personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, you may request us to amend it by contacting us by the means set out below in section 9. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it. You may also have your personal information deleted unless we are prohibited from doing so by law. We will let you know if we cannot delete your personal information for legal or other reasons.</p>
